# Abstract

The aim of this project is to assemble information about the products of different 
supermarkets in order that the consumers can quote their monthly supermarket list 
through a web page and compare the total value in the wide range of supermarkets. As 
a result, the users of our website will obtain the best purchase option and will save time 
instead of comparing products individually. The technologies needed for the 
development of this project are: AngularCLI for the development of the web interface; 
PostgreSQL, NodeJS and Express for the implementation of the database; and finally, 
Python for the collection of information.
